Algorithms and problems to pass coding interviews for software engineering roles

There are three main folders:
- Algorithms
	Here I tackle algorithmic problems such as sorting and searching
- Data Structures
	Here I discuss different data structures such as trees, heaps, tries, ... and some useful algorithms such as traversals
- Problems
	Here I solve different problems and practise for the real interview. There are problems that come from the "Cracking the Coding Inteview" book
