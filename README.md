# Coding Interview Resources


Algorithms and problems to pass coding interviews for software engineering positions. Most of the material is in Python.


## Algorithms:

Algorithmic problems such as sorting and searching

## Data Structures:

Data various such as trees, heaps, tries... as well as some useful algorithms such as traversals

An extensive list with all the algorithms and data structures can be found here:

## Problems:

Problems solved as part of the practise for the real interview.
